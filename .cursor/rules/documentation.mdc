# Feature Documentation Rules

## Mandatory README Updates

When modifying any file inside `apps/web/src/features/*/`, you **MUST** update the corresponding `README.md` in that feature folder.

### Trigger Conditions

Update the feature README when:
- Adding, removing, or renaming components
- Modifying component props or interfaces
- Adding, removing, or modifying hooks
- Changing exported types
- Modifying `index.ts` exports
- Adding new backend integrations (queries/mutations)

### Feature README Locations

| Feature | README Path |
|---------|-------------|
| Clients | `apps/web/src/features/clients/README.md` |
| Properties | `apps/web/src/features/properties/README.md` |
| Notary Offices | `apps/web/src/features/notary-offices/README.md` |

### What to Update

1. **Structure section**: Update folder tree if files changed
2. **Components section**: Update props interfaces and descriptions
3. **Hooks section**: Update return types and parameters
4. **Types section**: Update interfaces and type definitions
5. **Usage section**: Update examples if API changed
6. **Backend Integration**: Update queries/mutations list

### Example Workflow

```
1. READ features/clients/README.md first (for context)
2. Modify component in features/clients/components/
3. Update features/clients/index.ts if exports changed
4. Update features/clients/README.md with changes
5. Commit all changes together
```

## Pre-Work Context Loading

**BEFORE starting any work on a feature**, you **MUST** read the feature's README.md to understand:
- Current folder structure
- Existing components and their purposes
- Available hooks and their APIs
- Type definitions in use
- Backend integration patterns

This ensures you have full context before making changes and helps maintain consistency.

**Remember**: Documentation must stay in sync with code. Outdated docs mislead developers.
