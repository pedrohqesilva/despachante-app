# Design System Rules

## Component Library
- **Always use shadcn/ui components** for UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs, etc.)
- Before creating custom components, check if shadcn/ui has a suitable component
- Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` to add new shadcn components when needed
- Prefer shadcn components over custom implementations or other UI libraries

## Icons
- **Always use Lucide icons** for all iconography in the application
- Import icons from `lucide-react` package
- Use Lucide icons instead of other icon libraries (Font Awesome, Material Icons, etc.)
- Check Lucide's icon library at https://lucide.dev/icons before creating custom icons
- Use appropriate icon sizes with Tailwind classes (e.g., `size-4`, `size-5`, `size-6`)

## Styling
- **Always use Tailwind CSS** for all styling and layout
- Use Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS or inline styles
- Follow Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Use Tailwind's design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) from the theme configuration
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:) for responsive design
- Use Tailwind's dark mode utilities (dark:) when implementing dark mode support

## Component Structure
- When using shadcn components, customize them with Tailwind classes rather than modifying the component source directly
- Use Tailwind's `cn()` utility (from shadcn) for conditional class merging
- Maintain consistency with shadcn's design patterns and conventions

## Best Practices
- Combine shadcn components with Tailwind utilities to create cohesive, maintainable UI
- Use Tailwind's spacing scale for consistent margins and padding
- Leverage Tailwind's color palette for consistent theming
- Prefer Tailwind's flexbox and grid utilities for layouts
- Use Tailwind's typography plugin or utilities for text styling
